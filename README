Initial version to get some running code to the start line.
We use Gridcal JSON request http://grical.org/s/@berlin/json/
to populate the map with some icons.

It is based on Mapsforge and requires the library as a separate project
either from the svn repository or the library in lib
http://mapsforge.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mapsforge

The base application is the original AdvancedMapviewer application 
from the Mapsforge project.

For a full application of an Android app for Wheelmap.org the code 
both of the Grical part and the AdvancedMapviewer should be 
refactored.
